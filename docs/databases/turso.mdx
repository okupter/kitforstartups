Quoted from the [Turso documentation](https://docs.turso.tech),

<Note>
  Turso is an edge-hosted, distributed database based on libSQL, an open-source
  and open-contribution fork of SQLite. It was designed to minimize query
  latency for applications where queries come from anywhere in the world.
</Note>

It's an easy database to setup, and SQLite can be used quite easily on local environments.

Here is how to setup and use Turso with KitForStartups:

## Create a Turso database

Before creating a database, you'll need to install Turso CLI on your machine. Steps to do so can be found [here](https://docs.turso.tech/tutorials/get-started-turso-cli/step-01-installation).

Next, you can create a logical database using the following commands:

```bash
# Create a group
# https://docs.turso.tech/concepts#placement-group
turso group create my-group-name

# Create a database in the newly created group
# https://docs.turso.tech/concepts#database
turso db create my-db-name --group my-group
```

## Update environments variables

The next step is to update the environment variables in your `.env` file. You can find the values for these variables in the Turso console.

For Turso, we need `TURSO_DB_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`.

The token can be generated using the following command:

```bash
turso db tokens create my-db-name
```

For the DB URL, on local environments, you can use `turso dev` to invoke a libSQL server locally. This will open a websocket server that can be accessed on `ws://127.0.0.1:8080` (this will be the value for `TURSO_DB_URL`).

```bash
# Create a src/lib/drizzle/turso/data folder
turso dev -f src/lib/drizzle/turso/data/data.sqlite
```

## Search and replace the database configuration

In order to switch, the current option is to search and replace occurences of `drizzle/mysql` and `lucia/mysql` with `drizzle/turso` and `lucia/turso` respectively.

If you are using VSCode, you can exclude the `src/lib/drizzle` and `src/lib/lucia` folders from the search.
