import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

KitForStartups comes with the following databases already setup:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite through [Turso](https://turso.tech)

Per default, the starter uses MySQL. If you want to use another provider, you can update the imports file `src/routes` to use the correct database provider (using a search and replace for instance).

<Aside>
  We are planning to create a dedicated CLI for KitForStartups. This will
  simplify the process of switching between database providers. Checkout the
  [roadmap](/roadmap) for more information about this.
