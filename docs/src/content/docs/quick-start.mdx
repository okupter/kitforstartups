## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

The default configuration for KitForStartups uses SQLite as a database through [Turso](https://turso.tech).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MySQL 8.1+
- pnpm
- Docker Compose (optional)

### Installation

1. Setup

Clone or fork the `starter` folder of this repository:

```bash
degit https://github.com/okupter/kitforstartups/starter my-project
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd my-project
pnpm install
```

3. Setup the environment variables

Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Then, fill in the values for the environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Setup the database

For easy local development, there is a `./docker/mysql.yml` file that you can use to spin up a MySQL database in a Docker container. If you don't want to use Docker, you can install MySQL locally and skip this step.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/mysql.yml up -d
```

<Aside>Remember to update the MYSQL\_\* environment variables in the `.env` file with your database credentials.</Aside>

5. Run the migrations

We use [`Drizzle Kit`](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/overview) for automatic SQL migrations and prototyping.

To run the migrations for MySQL, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm generate-migrations:mysql
```

This will generate the SQL migrations, as well as migrations metadata files in the `./src/lib/server/db/mysql/migrations/data` directory.

You can now run the following command to push the migrations to the database:

```bash
pnpm migrate:mysql
```

In early stage of development or when you're at the prototyping stage, you can use directly update the database schema and run the following command to directly push the schema changes to the database:

```bash
pnpm push:mysql
```

6. Setup MailHog for local email testing

We use MailHog to send and test emails locally. The boilerplate is configured to automatically send emails to MailHog when running in development mode.

Check `./src/lib/emails/send.ts` for more details about the implementation.

We also provide a Docker Compose file to quickly spin up a MailHog container.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/mailhog.yml up -d
```

The MailHog server will be available at `http://localhost:8025`.

<Aside> Remember to update the TRANSACTIONAL\_EMAILS\_\* environment variables in the `.env` file with your sender name and address.</Aside>

7. Run the app

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Changing the database

Right now, there is no CLI or configuration file to change the database. You will have to do some search and replace in the codebase to change the database.

The default database is SQLite. If you want to use PostgreSQL, you will have to:

- Change occurences of `$lib/server/auth/lucia/turso` to `$lib/server/auth/lucia/postgres` in the `./src` directory
- Change occurences of `$lib/server/db/mysql/models` to `$lib/server/db/postgres/models` in the `./src` directory

This should be enough to get you started with PostgreSQL.

**PS**: This won't be necessary in the future, as we plan to add a central configuration file for the app and a CLI to generate a starter project with the database of your choice.
